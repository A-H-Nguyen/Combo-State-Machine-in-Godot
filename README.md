# Combo State Machine in Godot

## Project Description:
This is a combo system in the form of a virtual state machine built within the the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). 
The code and Godot project in this repository are free for anyone to compile and modify at their leisure.

This project was inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNza5q7sp4), and is currently built to be run entirely from within the Godot game engine.

## Installation:
All you need to do is download the folder named "combo_state_machine" and create a Godot project whose path is the same as that folder's.
Do note that the Godot Project and folder must have the same name.

## Using this Project:
Once the project is fully compiled, you will be able to use the left and right mouse buttons to do a variety of different attacks like so:

This project is meant to be flexible and customizable.
For example, it should be simple to delete the various state objects in the main node, and be left with only the animated sprite.
Furthermore, the code attached to the Node2D should be easily transplanted onto something like a KinematicBody2D.
The end goal of this project is to have a flexible architecture that can be reused and recycled in future game development projects, so feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my little project, and have a great day!
