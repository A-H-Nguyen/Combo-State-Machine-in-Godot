# Combo State Machine in Godot

## Project Description:
This is a flexible architecture for a combo system in the form of a virtual state machine built within the the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). 
The code and Godot project in this repository are free for anyone to compile and modify at their leisure.

This project was inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNza5q7sp4), and is currently built to be run entirely from within the Godot game engine.

## Installation
All you need to do is download the folder named "combo_state_machine" and create a Godot project whose path is the same as that folder's.
Do note that the Godot Project and folder must have the same name.
